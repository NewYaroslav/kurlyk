# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [v1.0.2] - 2026-04-23
- Added separate HTTP `request_id` and `group_id` semantics so individual requests can be cancelled by request ID while `HttpClient::cancel_requests()` cancels the client's request group.
- Added RAII-backed HTTP rate limit handles so pending requests keep their assigned limits alive until completion.
- Added HTTP response streaming callbacks via `HttpRequest::streaming`, `HttpClient::set_streaming(...)`, and callback overloads for standalone HTTP helpers.
- Added `HttpResponse::stream_chunk` to distinguish intermediate body chunks from the final ready response.
- Documented HTTP callback threading and disabled automatic retries after streaming chunks have been emitted.
- Fixed HTTP retry decisions so curl transfer errors can retry even when an HTTP status code was already received.
- Fixed Windows executable path conversion with C++20 `std::filesystem::path::u8string()`.
- Added CMake build integration with fallback dependency helpers for OpenSSL, libcurl, Asio, and Simple-WebSocket-Server.
- Added CI coverage for Linux and macOS smoke builds, Windows integration builds, and ODR regression tests.
- Switched Windows MinGW CI jobs from Chocolatey MinGW path assumptions to MSYS2 UCRT64 with Ninja.
- Added integration and ODR tests that verify singleton ownership across translation units and auto-initialization behavior.
- Fixed lifecycle cleanup so `deinit()` cleans up both asynchronous `init(true)` and synchronous `init(false)` modes.
- Updated auto-initialization cleanup to stop the `NetworkWorker` instead of only resetting managers.
- Added synchronous lifecycle regression coverage for repeated `deinit()` calls after `init(false)`.
- Added low-risk backpressure support with `SubmitResult`, a global HTTP pending queue cap, a per-client WebSocket send queue cap, explicit rejection errors, and integration/CI coverage for admission rejects.
- Refreshed README and README-RU usage, initialization, dependency, and configuration macro documentation.
- Added architecture documentation and expanded Doxygen mainpage guidance for startup, error handling, and manual lifecycle usage.
- Cleaned up public include compatibility around startup and utility headers while preserving the header-only API surface.
- Updated examples and comments for clearer console output, manual lifecycle handling, and non-pausing execution.
- Updated the Asio submodule to `asio-1-36-0`.
- Added optional sequential rate-limit mode (`create_rate_limit(..., sequential=true)`) so no other request sharing the limit may start while any request (including retries) is still in-flight.
- Added in-flight token tracking so sequential rate-limit locks are only released when `HttpRequestContext::complete()` is called (success, retry exhaustion, cancellation, or handler destruction).
- Added integration test and example coverage for the sequential rate-limit feature.

## [v1.0.1] - 2025-08-16
- Documented automatic initialization behavior on the Doxygen mainpage.
- Clarified example console output and refreshed example comments.
- Added error handler overview and documented centralized `KURLYK_HANDLE_ERROR` tracing.
- Documented configuration macros and corrected related Doxygen comments.
- Replaced example pause calls with `std::cin.get()` and improved usage comments.
- Fixed a hang during `cancel_requests()` and added error tracing dispatch through `NetworkWorker`.
- Improved the Doxygen main page structure and configuration macro coverage.
- Refined README configuration macro documentation.
- Added architecture and system-map guidance for contributors.

## [v1.0.0] - 2024-11-12
- Initial public release with header-only HTTP and WebSocket clients built on libcurl and Simple-WebSocket-Server.
- Added asynchronous HTTP request processing, callbacks, futures, retries, cancellation by request ID, and rate limiting.
- Added WebSocket client support with events, sending helpers, reconnection logic, proxy configuration, and timeout settings.
- Added proxy configuration, custom headers, `Accept-Language`, User-Agent helpers, and `sec-ch-ua` generation.
- Added HTTP timing metrics, HEAD request support, custom valid status codes, and timeout status handling.
- Added client, HTTP, curl, and WebSocket error categories with centralized error reporting.
- Added URL, path, encoding, email, percent-encoding, HTTP parsing, and case-insensitive header utilities.
- Added examples for simple HTTP requests, futures, proxies, redirects, nested requests, delayed requests, cancellation, and WebSocket echo usage.
- Reorganized the include structure into core, HTTP, WebSocket, types, utils, and startup modules.
- Added generated documentation styling and Doxygen configuration.
- Fixed Boost compatibility issues, C++17 compilation issues, Cyrillic path support, rate limiter timing, and blocked-site status handling.
